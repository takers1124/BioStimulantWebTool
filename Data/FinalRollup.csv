Public Land,Prescribed Fire,NA,Wooded Area,Northern,"If the fire was low intensity, active management may not be necessary for soil microbes to recover after the fire. If the fire was high intensity, but on more heavily regulated public land, you may not be able to implement PFMI because of restrictions. However, you could implement an uninoculated wattle to stimulate microbial growth and mitigate erosion. This approach does not directly use PFMI, but it does add a source of carbon (e.g. straw or woodships inside wattle) for soil microbes to easily metabolize and grow. If you are still interested in PFMI and would like a free consultation, please contact us and we would be happy to help find the best practice for the land you manage. "

Private Land,Wildfire,NA,Wooded Area,Northern,"You could implement PFMI on the burned land. The primary methods for implementing PFMI are to inoculate wattles with: (1) soil from a nearby unburned reference site, (2) a single species of native fungi, such as a pleurotus spp., (3) a compost tea made from a bioactive compost.
