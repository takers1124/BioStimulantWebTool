QuestionCode,Option,RecommendationDisplay,
A,Public Land,"Public land is most conservatively managed. The PFMI options for these landscapes are more limited and may require special permits/permissions. Speak with the agency managing the land before you procede with any active restoration treatments. However, you may still be able to use a non-PFMI approach to stimulating growth of soil microbes. "
A,Private Land,"On private land, management approaches can be more innovative. For example, you could use a PFMI method (e.g. a soil inoculant) to stimulate microbial growth after a fire. "
B,Prescribed Fire,"Prescribed burns, if they remain under control from start to finish, tend to be low intensity and small. They usually do not negatively impact soil organisims in the long run and therefore soil communities will recover on their own without need for a management intervention. However, if soils have been disturbed in other ways (e.g. from intensive agriculture), you may still consider PFMI or a different approach to stimulate microbial growth (e.g. an uninoculated wattle). "
B,Wildfire,"Wildfire can be low intensity and limited in range, but they are more often large and high intensity fires that can cause long-term negative impacts on soil organisms. Our FENiXS study tested PFMI as an active restoration approach after high intensity wildfires in 5 areas from Southern California to Southern Oregon."
C,Structure,"Oh, no! If fire on land you manage burned man-made structures, we recommend you test soil and water on this land for pollutants from biulding materials, electronics, home goods, and furniture. In our FENiXS study, soils around structure fires had heavy metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) contaminants. We tested 5 different PFMI treatments (including a control) to see if active restoration of soil microbial communities would reduce soil pollutants. "
C,No Structure,"Phew, no structures burned! When man-made structures burn, there is additional concern about pollutants from electronics, household goods, and furniture to account for."
D,Wooded Area,"If the fire took place in or near a wooded or forested area, it's likely to have burned at greater intensity and the soil microbial community may benefit from active restoration with PFMI. "
D,Other Ecosystem,"If the fire did not happen in or near a wooded or forested area, it's likely to have burned at low intensity and likely did not have long-term negative impacts on soil organisims. This ecosystem will recover on its own soon."
E,Northern,"You're in the North, we have three experimental sites for the FENiXS study in your region. Burns in these areas tend to increase total nitrogen, organic matter, total carbon and the carbon accessible to microbes. These different starting nutrients may impact the effect of FPFMI treatments."
E,Southern,"You're in the South, we have two experimental sites for the FENiXS study in your region. Burns in these areas tend to decrease the total nitrogen, nitrate, organic material, and carbon (both active and CO2-carbon). These different starting nutrients may impact the effect of FPFMI treatments."
